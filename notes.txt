method - how to do something
process (declarative knowledge) - what you're looking for
    - like a magical spirit
procedure
    - a pattern of rules that controls a process


Techniques for controlling complexity
=====================================
Black box abstraction
    - not having to know what goes on inside
Conventional interfaces
    - generic operations
    - large-scale structure and modularity
        - object-oriented programming
        - operations on aggregates
Metalinguistic abstraction
    - how to construct new languages
    - we can use lisp to build a new language (such as a logic

LEARNING LISP
====================
PRIMATIVE ELEMENTS
Means of combination
Means of abstraction

combination
(+ 3 17.4 5) -> 25.4

parentheis means a combination

lambda is lisps way of saying "make a procedure"
There is no difference between these two:
    (define square (lambda (x) (* x x) ))
    (define (square x) (* x x))
